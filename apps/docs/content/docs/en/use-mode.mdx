## Installation?

As mentioned in the introduction, I7A/UI is not a library in the traditional sense but rather a collection of reusable components that you can directly incorporate into your project. Therefore, there is no single installation for the entire set. Instead, each component includes its source code available in the documentation, ready to be copied, adapted, and used according to your needs.

  <CalloutDescription>
    For the components to work correctly, it is necessary to install some
    complementary utilities that work alongside CSS. Below are the ones you need
    to consider.

## Utilities

<Steps>

  <Step>
    Install the following utilities to ensure the components work correctly:

    ```bash
    pnpm i clsx tailwind-merge
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a utility file in your project, for example, `utils.ts`, and copy the following code:

    ```ts
    import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
    import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

    export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
      return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
    }
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>
