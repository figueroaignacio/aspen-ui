## What is I7A/UI?

Inspired by tools like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com), [Radix](https://radix-ui.com) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com). I7A/UI is a set of user interface components that can be used to create modern and attractive web applications. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, allowing developers to focus on creating exceptional user experiences. UI

## Motivation

This project was born out of curiosity and the need to build a collection of useful components for myself and other developers who prefer not to start from scratch when creating components. Its goal is to provide a solid foundation for developing modern web applications without sacrificing flexibility or customization. By combining good design and development practices, I7A/UI aims to simplify the creation of attractive, functional, and adaptable user interfaces.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is I7A/UI a copy-and-paste library?

Exactly. This project aims to provide reusable and customizable components that you can easily copy and paste. However, it is important to clarify that it is **NOT** a "library" in the traditional sense, as it does not require the installation of a dependency.

### Are the components designed exclusively for React projects?

Although the components are built with React, you can adapt them to any framework or library of your choice. The main idea is that the code is reusable and flexible, allowing you to adjust it to the needs of your project.

### Should I use Tailwind or CSS Modules?

The choice is entirely yours. The components are compatible with both Tailwind and CSS Modules, so you can choose the option that best suits your workflow or preferences.

### Why use TypeScript?

We recommend using TypeScript, as it is currently a standard practice for developing safer and more robust projects. TypeScript helps you catch errors during development and enhances the experience of working with modern web applications.
