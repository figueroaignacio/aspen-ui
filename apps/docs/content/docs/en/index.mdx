## What is I7A/UI?

Inspired by tools like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [Radix](https://radix-ui.com), I7A/UI is a set of user interface components designed to help build modern and visually appealing web applications. It’s built to be easy to use and customize, allowing developers to focus on crafting exceptional user experiences.

## Motivation

This project was born out of curiosity and the need to build a collection of components useful both for myself and for other developers who prefer not to start from scratch. Its goal is to provide a solid foundation for modern web development without sacrificing flexibility or customization. By combining best practices in design and development, I7A/UI aims to simplify the creation of attractive, functional, and adaptable user interfaces.

## Open Source

I7A/UI is an open-source project, meaning anyone can contribute to its growth and improvement. If you have ideas, suggestions, or enhancements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/figueroaignacio/i7a-ui). Your contribution is greatly appreciated and helps build a stronger community around I7A/UI.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is I7A/UI a copy-paste library?

Well, not exactly. This project aims to provide reusable and customizable components that you can copy and paste, but it’s not a “library” in the traditional sense, as it doesn’t act as a dependency.

### Are the components only for React-based projects?

No. While the components are built with React, you can adapt them to any framework or library of your choice. The idea is to reuse the code and tailor it to your specific needs.
