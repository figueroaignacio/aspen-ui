**What does "not a component library" mean?**

AspenUI is not a traditional component library. There's no need to install or configure anything—simply copy the components you need and paste them into your project. Integration is straightforward, relying on familiar tools that most developers are already using.

AspenUI gives you full control. Select the components you want, customize them to suit your needs, and integrate them seamlessly into your project.

## About

I'm Ignacio Figueroa, the creator of AspenUI, a collection of simple, reusable components designed for seamless integration into any project. Inspired by open-source projects like Aceternity, ShadCN, and Radix, AspenUI prioritizes minimalism, customizability, and ease of use.

I wanted to create my own set of lightweight components that are easy to copy, paste, and adapt, offering flexibility without unnecessary dependencies or constraints.

AspenUI helps developers streamline their workflow with flexible UI elements that make web development faster and more enjoyable.
