**What does "not a component library" mean?**

AspenUI is not a traditional component library. There's no need to install or configure anything—simply copy the components you need and paste them into your project. Integration is straightforward, relying on familiar tools that most developers are already using.

AspenUI gives you full control. Select the components you want, customize them to suit your needs, and integrate them seamlessly into your project.

## FAQ

**How do I use AspenUI components?**

Just pick the components you need, copy the code, and paste it into your project. There's no installation or dependency management involved, and you can easily customize the components to match your design.

**Do I need to install any dependencies?**

While AspenUI doesn't require installation, some components might work better with common utilities or tools that are often used in modern web development. These tools are typically easy to integrate, ensuring the components function as expected.

**Can I modify the components?**

Yes, AspenUI is fully customizable. Once you've copied the code, you have the freedom to modify it to meet the unique needs of your project, including adjusting styles, functionality, and behavior.

**Is AspenUI compatible with any framework?**

Absolutely! AspenUI is framework-agnostic. Although it's optimized for React, you can easily adapt the components to work with other frameworks or even plain HTML.

**How can I contribute or suggest improvements?**

We welcome suggestions and contributions! AspenUI is open for use, and we’d love to hear your ideas for making it even better. Don’t hesitate to reach out with your feedback.

## Why I Created AspenUI

My name is **Ignacio Figueroa**, and I created **AspenUI** to address the need for simple, reusable components that can be easily integrated into any project. After working with a variety of design systems and UI libraries, I realized that many projects required flexibility and the ability to customize components without having to deal with the complexity of installing and managing dependencies.

I wanted to create my own set of components that were easy to use, customizable, and based on the principles of minimalism and simplicity. AspenUI is the result of that vision—components that you can simply copy, paste, and adapt to your needs.

The project draws inspiration from various open-source projects such as **Aceternity**, **ShadCN**, and **Radix**, incorporating the best practices from those libraries while ensuring that AspenUI is lightweight and doesn't impose unnecessary constraints on the user.

By building AspenUI, I aimed to offer developers a straightforward solution to enhance their projects with reusable UI elements, making web development faster, easier, and more enjoyable.
