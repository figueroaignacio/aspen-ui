## What makes AspenUI stand out?

- **Not your typical library**: Rather than forcing you to install a complete library of components, **AspenUI** offers a more flexible approach. Here, you get access to standalone components that you can copy, paste, and tweak as needed, cutting down on bloated dependencies.
- **Accessibility-first design**: We believe in making the web accessible to all. Every component is built with accessibility at its core, following best practices to ensure usability for everyone, including users with disabilities.

- **Fully customizable and flexible**: You’re not limited by pre-defined styles or themes. **AspenUI** components are fully customizable, allowing you to modify everything from appearance to behavior to align with your project’s brand and vision.

- **Open source and community-driven**: We value collaboration and transparency. **AspenUI** is open source, meaning developers are free to contribute, improve, and suggest new components, keeping the kit constantly evolving.

## Why choose AspenUI?

1. **Faster development**: Instead of building components from scratch, you can jumpstart your projects by using pre-built, modern UI elements. Just copy, paste, and start customizing.

2. **Focus on design and functionality**: Each component is designed with both aesthetics and performance in mind, ensuring that your app looks professional and functions smoothly without extra effort.

3. **No dependency bloat**: You’re not tied to a monolithic library. Use only what you need, with the freedom to customize, refactor, and integrate as per your requirements.

4. **Future-proof and flexible**: Since the components are not bundled into a single library, you retain control over your codebase, ensuring that your project remains future-proof and adaptable to changes.
