## What is this project about?

AspenUI was born out of the need to create a custom design system that reflects my skills in frontend design and layout. Inspired by tools like RadixUI, shadcn/ui, and Aceternity, I decided to build a collection of reusable and accessible components to facilitate the creation of modern and elegant interfaces. The goal of this project is to provide flexible, optimized, and easy-to-integrate solutions for your web development projects.
